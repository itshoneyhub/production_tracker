feat: UI/UX improvements and Stages master list correction

This commit implements several UI/UX enhancements and corrects the Stages master list.

UI/UX Improvements:
- Implemented project list pagination (25 projects per page).
- Moved the "Add" button to the right-hand side in the project form.
- Styled the "Production Stage" field to match other form fields.
- Repositioned the "Logout" button to the top-right corner and applied consistent styling.
- Ensured full responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Stages Master List Correction:
- Updated `backend/seed.sql` to reflect the hardcoded Stages master list from `Master.jsx`.
- Ensured the SQL `Stages` table contains only these specific stages.
